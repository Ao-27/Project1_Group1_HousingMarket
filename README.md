### Main objective of the project:
    The primary objective of this project is to furnish a profound and all-encompassing data analysis, accompanied by profound insights, to aid an           investment realtor in pinpointing the optimal city among Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver for constructing new residential properties. 

    The analysis will be centered around examination of historical housing market trends. A group of 4 data analysts will harness pertinent datasets and     use  statistical techniques to deliver actionable recommendations that empower the investment realtor in making well-informed decisions.

### Methodology/steps:
    Data Collection : Our journey commenced with the acquisition of the raw data from trusted sources being Statistics Canada and the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). These sources can be found under the references tab. We could retreivered from these website the date, the location in the country (province and city), and the status. 
    
    Data Analysis : 
    For the data cleaning, in other words getting our hands on the data, we first we imported our csv files and the library inside of pythons. Example of libraries are:
        1. from pathlib import Path
        2. from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        3. from scipy import stats
        4. import numpy as np
        5. import pandas as pd
        With the data loaded into our analytical environment, we moved on to the critical phase of data cleaning. By selecting relevant columns, we focused our      efforts on the key variables crucial to understanding the housing market dynamics in these cities. This step not only streamlined the analysis but also enhanced the clarity of our insights. We also performed some renaming of field to make sure the filed name where relevant and under stable for everyone in the team. Then, we removed specific rows based on the "STATUS" values. This rigorous process allowed us to exclude any questionable or invalid data, or irrelevant one from our analysis. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive picture of the housing market, we took great care to remove rows with empty or "House only" "NewHousePrice_Index_Type". With a refined and polished dataset, we embarked on a city-specific analysis to uncover unique trends and patterns in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montr√©al. These cities serve as economic powerhouses and hold immense influence over the national real estate market. We finally made sure to export the dataset to serves as a valuable resource as a cross reference and overall validation
